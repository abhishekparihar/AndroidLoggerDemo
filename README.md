AndroidLoggerDemo
=================

This example shows how to use Logs in Debug mode and in release Mode

Always use LogUtils.java file to use logs in android app.

Before uploading build to market always make sure that you have set the debug mode to false.

Using LogUtils.java, we don't have to comment each and every log before releasing app.
